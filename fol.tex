% [A ``presheaf on a multicategory'' for dependent types: motivate as the ``contravariant representables''.]

% Quantifiers: Need
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Adjoints to pullback along projections
% \item (strict) BC for pullbacks of projections (for substitution)
% \item Frobenius/Hopf for left adjoints (for elim in arbitrary context) = ``FHL left adjoint'' of multicategories
% \end{itemize}

% Equality: need
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Left adjoint to pullback along diagonal (for Lawvere/Martin-L\"of rule, when applied to $\top$)
% \item (strict) BC for pullbacks of $(\Delta\times 1)$ along $(1\times f)$ (for substitution)
% \item Frobenius/Hopf (for Lawvere in arbitrary context) = ``FHL left adjoint''
% \end{itemize}
% Since $\Delta$ has a retraction, the whole left adjoint can be recovered from its value at $\top$.
% Now FHL gives general transport, which by instantiation gives Paulin-Mohring.
% This (together with $\exists$) should allow us to construct left adjoints to pullback along arbitrary morphisms by Lawvere's formula, and also to prove BC for ``sliding and splitting'' and the ``Frobenius law''.
