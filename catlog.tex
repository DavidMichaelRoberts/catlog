\section{Appetizer: inverses in group objects}
\label{sec:intro}

As an example to motivate what follows, and give some idea of the power and flexibility of categorical logic as a tool for category theory, we consider several different faces of the following theorem:

\begin{thm}
  If a monoid has inverses (hence is a group), then those inverses are unique.
\end{thm}

When ``monoid'' and ``group'' have their usual meaning, namely sets equipped with structure, the proof is easy.
For any $x$, if $i(x)$ and $j(x)$ are both two-sided inverse of $x$, then we have
\[ i(x) = i(x) \cdot e = i(x) \cdot (x \cdot j(x)) = (i(x)\cdot x)\cdot j(x) = e\cdot j(x) = j(x) \]
However, the theorem is true much more generally than this.
We consider first the case of monoid/group objects in a category with products.
A \emph{monoid object} is an object $M$ together with maps $m:M\times M \to M$ and $e:1\to M$ satisfying associativity and unitality axioms:
\begin{equation}
  \vcenter{\xymatrix{
      M\times M\times M\ar[r]^-{1\times m}\ar[d]_{m\times 1} &
      M\times M\ar[d]^m\\
      M\times M\ar[r]_m &
      M
    }}
  \qquad
  \vcenter{\xymatrix{ M \ar[r]^-{(1,e)} \ar[dr]_{1} &
    M\times M \ar[d]_m & M \ar[l]_-{(e,1)} \ar[dl]^{1} \\
    & M }}
\end{equation}
An \emph{inverse operator} for a monoid object is a map $i:M\to M$ such that
\begin{equation}
  \vcenter{\xymatrix@C=1pc{& M\times M \ar[rr]^{i\times 1} && M\times M \ar[dr]^m \\
      M \ar[ur]^{\Delta} \ar[dr]_{\Delta} \ar[rr]^{!} && 1 \ar[rr]^{e} && M \\
      & M\times M \ar[rr]_{1\times i} && M\times M \ar[ur]_{m}}}
\end{equation}
The internalized claim, then, is that any two inverse operators are equal.
The \emph{internal logic of a category with products} allows us to prove this by using essentially the same argument that we did in the case of ordinary monoids in \bSet.
The morphisms $m$ and $e$ are represented in this logic by the notations
\begin{mathpar}
  x:M,y:M \types x\cdot y :M \and
  \types e:M.
\end{mathpar}
Don't worry if this notation doesn't make a whole lot of sense yet.
The symbol $\types$ (called a ``turnstile'') is the logic version of a morphism arrow $\to$.
The fact that $m$ is a morphism $M\times M \to M$ is indicated by the fact that $M$ appears twice to the left of $\types$ and once to the right; the comma ``$,$'' in between $x:M$ and $y:M$ represents the product $\times$, and the variables $x,y$ are there so that we have a good notation ``$x\cdot y$'' for the morphism $m$.
In particular, the notation $x:M,y:M \types x\cdot y :M$ should be bracketed as
\[ ((x:M),(y:M)) \types ((x\cdot y) :M). \]
Similarly, the associativity, unit, and inverse axioms are indicated by the notations
\begin{mathpar}
  x:M,y:M,z:M \types (x\cdot y)\cdot z = x\cdot (y\cdot z) : M \\
  x:M \types x\cdot e = x : M \and
  x:M \types e\cdot x = x : M \\
  x:M \types x\cdot i(x) = e : M \and
  x:M \types i(x) \cdot x = e : M
\end{mathpar}
Now the \bSet-based proof can be essentially copied in this notation:
\[ x:M \types i(x) = i(x) \cdot e = i(x) \cdot (x \cdot j(x)) = (i(x)\cdot x)\cdot j(x) = e\cdot j(x) = j(x) : M.\]
The essential point is that the notation \emph{looks set-theoretic}, with ``variables'' representing ``elements'', and yet (as we will see) its formal structure is such that it can be interpreted into \emph{any} category with products.
Therefore, writing the proof in this way yields automatically a proof of the general theorem that any two inverse \emph{operators} for a monoid \emph{object} in a category with products are equal.
